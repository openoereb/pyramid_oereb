pyramid\_oereb (Ã–REB-Server)
============================

|Build Status|

*pyramid\_oereb* is an open-source implementation of the server side
part for the swiss `"Cadastre of Public-law Restrictions on
landownership"
(PLR-cadastre) <https://www.cadastre.ch/en/oereb.html>`__.

It is written in Python and designed as a plugin for the `Pyramid Web
Framework <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/>`__.
This allows *pyramid\_oereb* to be included in any Pyramid web
application.

Installation
------------

**Note:** Installing *pyramid\_oereb* requires a running Pyramid web
application.

1. If not already existent, set up a Pyramid web application.
2. Install the Python package *pyramid\_oereb* in the Python environment
   of your application.

   ::

       pip install pyramid_oereb

3. Include the Pyramid plugin in your application. Edit the
   application's main method and add the following line:

   .. code:: python

       config.include('pyramid_oereb', route_prefix='oereb')

   It is recommended to define a route prefix like "oereb" or something
   similar (You are free to choose whatever prefix you like).
4. Add your configuration as described in the following section.
5. Restart your web server. The PLR webservice should now be available
   under the specified route prefix.

Configuration
-------------

Basic idea
~~~~~~~~~~

You are looking at a highly configurable piece of software. To get the
right understanding of the server it is recommended to read this part
carefully.

Since the confederations definition and the specification for the
extract of OEREB data is really straight we had very narrow margins to
develop the code. Using this pyramid plugin you will get a running
server instance which is able to provide the services with output
satisfying the specification of the confederation. But to get this
extract you need to bind the data to this server. And this is basically
what you need to configure.

For configuration we use the
`YAML <http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html>`__ system. It is a handy
way to separate config in a human and machine readable way in text
files.

So the first goal for configuration is to have such a YAML file. To
point out which way you should go please follow this workflow sheet:

.. figure:: doc/images/configuration_workflow.png

   Screenshot

After you know now what way you want to go you are probably curious what
you add as configuration content. This is simple: Mainly all content
from the `pyramid\_oereb.yaml <pyramid_oereb.yml>`__.

It contains the basic configuration which can be used as a start point.

The structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you open the `pyramid\_oereb.yaml <pyramid_oereb.yml>`__ you see
"pyramid\_oreb" in the first line. This is the section. This is the
entry point of the configuration. When ever you copy this config content
to a own config file, take care that this section needs to be at the
most left (without spaces in front). This ensures that it will be
available by the oereb application.

For further information read the comments inside this file attentively.

Running development version locally and standalone
--------------------------------------------------

You can checkout the current master and run *pyramid\_oereb* locally,
but we cannot guarantee a working configuration as it is under
development. We recommend to use a linux system but the application is
tested and may also be used in a windows environment.

Requirements: - git - python - virutalenv - docker - make

After installing the listed requirements, clone the repository and enter
its directory.

::

    git clone https://github.com/camptocamp/pyramid_oereb.git
    cd pyramid_oereb

You can set up the virtual environment using ``make install`` and run
the unit tests using ``make checks``.

To start a local server run ``make serve``. It should be available unter
http://localhost:6543/oereb/, e.g. http://localhost:6543/oereb/versions.
To stop the server, press ``CTRL + C``.

Running development version on a up and running already existing pyramid\_server
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before you start whith the following instructions you should think about
creating a branch of your applications code to not mess things up.

1.  In the setup.py add "pyramid\_oereb" in the list of requirements
    (often a python list stored in the variable "requires")
2.  If you are using virtual environment enable it:
    ``source <path_to_your_venv>/bin/activate``
3.  run the following command (This will install all new requirements):
    ``pip install -e.``
4.  Now you have installed the pyramid oereb package
5.  In the root folder of your pyramid app (the one where the setup.py
    is stored too) run the command: ``create_standard_yaml``
6.  You got a configuration file which contains all standard things (a
    yaml, and two logo png files). **IMPORTANT:** There are several
    places where database connections are defined. They all are defined
    like this:
    ``db_connection: postgresql://postgres:password@localhost/pyramid_oereb``,
    you **MUST** adapt this to your database configuration. Note that
    the database you specify here must exist and it must be able to
    handle spacial data (postgis,...). **This connections are used later
    to create/drop standard tables and fill database with standard
    data.** HINT: Use *find and replace* of your favorite editor and
    replace all connection definitions. In addition to the database
    connection you can find a line with the content:
    ``canton: YOUR_LOGO_HERE!``. Place a png file representing your
    cantonal logo in this folder and replace 'YOUR\_LOGO\_HERE!' with
    the name of your logo.
7.  Open the development.ini file and add two lines to the end of the
    "[app:main]" block

    ::

        pyramid_oereb.cfg.file = pyramid_oereb_standard.yml
        pyramid_oereb.cfg.section = pyramid_oereb

8.  Do the same in the production.ini file
9.  In the **init** file of your application inside of the main method
    add this line just before the config.scan() call.

    ::

        config.include('pyramid_oereb', route_prefix='oereb')

10. execute the command in the folder where you created the
    pyramid\_oereb.yml to make sure having a clean database for start
    (this should only influence the pyramid\_oereb related data):

    ::

        drop_standard_tables -c pyramid_oereb_standard.yml

11. execute the command in the folder where you created the
    pyramid\_oereb.yaml:

    ::

        create_standard_tables -c pyramid_oereb_standard.yml

12. execute the command in the folder where you created the
    pyramid\_oereb.yaml (this will create a test data set):

    ::

        load_standard_sample_data -c pyramid_oereb_standard.yml

13. Check with a tool of your choise that the structure was created
    successfully in you desired database. You should find 17 database
    schemas named (snake\_case) by their code attribute from the yml
    file. Plus one schema called "pyramid\_oereb\_main" containing the
    app global stuff (addresses, municipalities, etc.). At least these
    tables need to be filled up with your data with a tool of your
    choise).
14. Start your pyramid application.
15. Point your browser to: /oereb/extract/embeddable/json/CH113928077734
