"""
This is representing the applications working data schema. It provides buckets for general data you will need
to run this application in standard mode.
The buckets are:

* Municipality
* Real Estate
* Address
* Glossary
* Exclusion of liability

The geographical projection system which is used out of the box is LV95 aka EPSG:2056. Of course you can
configure a different one.
The name of the schema will be::

    pyramid_oereb_main

But you can change it also via configuration.

    .. note::

        Whenever you configure your own sqlalchemy ORM's to use them in this application you must imitate
        the behaviour of the ORM's here. This means the names class variables as well as the types of these
        variables.
