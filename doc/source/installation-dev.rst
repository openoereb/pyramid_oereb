Installation for DEV's
======================

``pyramid_oereb`` is a piece of python software following the rules of the pyramid webframework. To develop
features there are basically two ways to setup:

# Docker/Docker-Compose
# local system python with a virtualenv

We recommend the Docker way since ``pyramid_oereb`` has dependencies around the geos/gdal/ogr stack which
might easily conflict with versions installed in a daily used system and therefore might lead to problems.<s<s
