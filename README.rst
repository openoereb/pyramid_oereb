``pyramid_oereb`` (Ã–REB-Server)
===============================

|Build Status| |Requirements Status|

``pyramid_oereb`` is an open-source implementation of the server side part for the swiss `"Cadastre of
Public-law Restrictions on landownership" (PLR-cadastre) <https://www.cadastre.ch/en/oereb.html>`__.

It is written in Python and designed as a plugin for the `Pyramid Web Framework
<http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/>`__. This allows ``pyramid_oereb`` to be
included in any Pyramid web application.

Please refer to the `documentation <https://openoereb.github.io/pyramid_oereb/>`__ for detailed
information and instructions for installation and configuration.

If you are interested in contributing or extending the project, take a look at the
`contribution page <https://openoereb.github.io/pyramid_oereb/doc/contrib/>`__.

Local testing (quick preview)
=============================

Run dev server
--------------

Following packages are required: ``python3-venv`` ``postgresql-client`` ``libpq-dev``

Clone project:

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone git@github.com:openoereb/pyramid_oereb.git
  cd pyramid_oereb

The credentials for the connection to the statistics database have to be provided in a .env file (not committed, copy sample.env and edit it if necessary):

.. code-block:: bash

  cp sample.env .env

Run:

.. code-block:: bash

  make serve

JSON reduced extract is accessible at: http://localhost:6543/oereb/extract/reduced/json/CH113928077734.


**When running in to issues installing** ``libpq-dev`` **:**

.. code-block:: bash

  The following packages have unmet dependencies:
   libpq-dev : Depends: libpq5 (= 10.12-0ubuntu0.18.04.1) but 12.3-1.pgdg18.04+1 is to be installed


Try to install a specific version (adapt the version to your requirement):

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo apt install libpq5=10.12-0ubuntu0.18.04.1


Run tests
---------

To check your code, run `make checks`. It will run style checks and tests. It's also possible to
run sub-target independently:

- `make checks-style` to run only style-related checks (linting).
- `make tests` to run tests. Python 3.7 is used by default. But you can run tests with another version by
  running: `PYTHON_TEST_VERSION=python3.x make tests`. You can also set this variable in the Makefile.

After running tests, the coverage is available in the folder `coverage_report`.
