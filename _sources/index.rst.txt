``pyramid_oereb`` is an open-source implementation of the server side
part for the swiss `"Cadastre of Public-law Restrictions on
landownership"
(PLR-cadastre) <https://www.cadastre.ch/en/oereb.html>`__.

It is written in Python and designed as a plugin for the `Pyramid Web
Framework <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/>`__.
This allows ``pyramid_oereb`` to be included in any Pyramid web
application.

If you are planning to run an own instance of ``pyramid_oereb``, we suggest to read the sections
:ref:`installation` and :ref:`configuration` to get started.

Architecture
------------

The application is separated into different layers to provide different points to hook into it for easier
customization.

The server provides access to the 4 services:

* GetExtractById
* GetEGRID
* GetCapabilities
* GetVersions

The server is able to use several specific external api endpoints to fetch data at runtime (e.g. ÖEREBlex or GeoAdmin
API). These need to be configured and prepared by the integrator of this package. Please read the dedicated part
of documentation.

For the moment we provide an adapter to get the PDF static extract from mapfishprint and
`oereb_xml_pdf_service <https://github.com/Geocloud-AG/oereb_xml_pdf_service>`__.

As mentioned above we used a layer architecture for this project. See following graphic:
